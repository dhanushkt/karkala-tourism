                    <p class="text"><em><strong>Kere Basadi</strong> </em>is located in
                        <em><strong>Varanga</strong></em>, a small village 26kms from Karkala, Udupi. Varanga is a
                        popular Jain pilgrim center. The village is a home for many centuries old ancient Basadis. The
                        word Varanga is also closely associated with Varangacharita, a&nbsp;novel on fictional prince
                        Varanga to preach principles of <em><strong>Jainism</strong></em>. The main Basadis here are
                        <em><strong>Neminatha Basadi (Here Basadi), Chandranatha Basadi (Matada Basadi) and Kere
                                Basadi.</strong></em></p>
                    <p class="text">Varanga Basadis are one of the ancient structural Jain temples of Karkala. They were
                        built in 13th century by Varanga Raja. The Varanga Basadis are built with four symmetrically
                        looking entrances leading to garbagriha of Jain&nbsp;Tirthankaras.</p>

                    <p class="text">
                        Using the Google navigation, we reached Varanga at 1 pm. As we landed, we were awestruck gazing
                        at the structure. A vast temple (Neminatha Basadi) enclosed within ancient walls. The lush green
                        paddy fields soothed our eyes.

                        the Kere Basadi is hidden in the center of the lake, which we found later]. We all exclaimed
                        “Wow” and were happy to witness this view. We parked the car and headed towards the temple.</p>

                    <p class="text">The grassy path paved the way to Neminatha Basadi. There stood the ancient Jain
                        temple, built in 1329. It is also referred to as Here Basadi – Big temple. The entrance of the
                        Basadi has huge pillars, roofing old tiles and mentions the history of the temple dated 1008AD.

                        Tirthankaras in meditation posture.&nbsp;Neminatha is the <em><strong>22nd
                                Tirthankara</strong></em> of Jainism and is considered to be most worshipped among
                        Jains. He is also considered to be the “God of village Varanga”. The temple has a history of
                        dated back to 1200 years. It is believed that Varanga Raja – king of Varanga, gifted the village
                        to Neminatha Swamy for the purpose of preaching Jainism</p><br>

                        administration along with the villagers maintain the paddy field and is never left barren. This
                        adds beauty to the Basadi and scenery is still fresh in our minds.</p>
                    <p class="text">Meanwhile, I was pondering about the Kere Basadi and my eyes were continuously
                        searching for the view seen on social media. We noticed few people walking further beyond the
                        Paddy field across a small house structure. We decided to follow them and explore more.</p>
                    <p class="text">As we walked further, we came across a Malnad house like structure which is known as
                        Chandranatha Basadi. It is referred as Matada Basadi as it houses the <em><strong>Varanga Jain
                                Mutt</strong></em>. The main deity worshipped here is Chandraprabha, 8th Tirthankara.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">The Jain mutt is functional and there were around 15 students learning here. It is
                        maintained by Sree Hombuja Jain Mutt. The interiors of this Basadi looks like a typical Malnad
                        home with beautiful wooden structures.</p>
                    <p class="text">We were fortunate to meet the secretary of the mutt – Yuvaraja Ariga Sir, who gave
                        us a great insight into the place. He was so humble and offered us a sumptuous lunch when we
                        enquired about the hotels nearby. Spending time with him helped us to understand the
                        significance of Varanga and Jainism. Thanks to him </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading" id="about"><u>Discovering Kere Basadi</u></h3>
                    <p class="text">We walked further and another mystery awaited us – a big lake surrounded by tall
                        coconut trees. As we gazed across the lake, we noticed another Basadi in the center of the lake
                        – Kere Basadi. “This is what I was searching for”- I exclaimed.</p>
                    <p class="text">When we enquired on reaching there with Yuvraj Sir, he told us that there is a
                        <em><strong>ferry</strong></em> available which the priest would row and that’s how we would
                        reach the Kere Basadi. We also realized that this is where recent movie Mugulunage climax was
                        shot. We bought tickets for Rs.5 each and started to walk near the ferry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading" id="about"><u>The beautiful Kere Basadi</u></h3>
                    <p class="text">As we neared the entrance, the view was Breathtaking !! Beautiful Basadi in the
                        center of the lake filled with green aquatic plants. The tall coconut trees in the background.
                        Moreover, the reflection of the Basadi in the calm water looked fabulous. What more to ask for!.
                        We were feeling awesome with these fantastic views.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading" id="about"><u>The ferry ride fun</u></h3>
                    <p class="text">The lake is approximately 28ft deep and is full of aquatic plants and fishes, we
                        enjoyed playing with them. We boarded the blue ferry, which was our Titanic feeling for some
                        time&nbsp;:D. Few Titanic poses Toh Banta hai
                        The priest arrived with other tourists near the ferry and he held a big log to row the ferry.
                        Everyone boarded the ferry and the ferry started. It was literally scary as it tilting almost 45
                        degrees while he rowed. We adjusted ourselves so that the ferry would remain balanced. The ride
                        was awesome and adventurous with no life jackets As the basadi was nearing, the priest turned
                        the ferry almost 180 degrees, which was so exciting ></p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading" id="about"><u>Kere Basadi – An abode of Jainism</u></h3>
                    <p class="text">The Kere Basadi looked like a lotus in the center of the green calm lake:). It is
                        also called as Chaturmukha Basadi as it is a square symmetrical structure with four identical
                        entrances. The whole temple is supported by a small compound. The walls of the Basadi is built
                        with granites. There is a small well also present inside the temple premises.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is dedicated to <em><strong>Lord Parshwanatha, 23rd Tirthankara</strong></em> of
                        Jainism. It also houses <em><strong>Lord Ananthanatha</strong></em>, <em><strong>Lord
                                Shanthintha</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Goddess Padmavathi</strong></em>. We sought
                        the blessings.</p>
                    <p class="text">The lake view from this Basadi is great. We traversed around the temple for some
                        time to capture beautiful sights of nature. The whole atmosphere was so peaceful. A wish to stay
                        there amidst nature.</p>
                    <p class="text">We spent around 20 minutes and had to head back. This was a new experience for all
                        of us. We were happy to see this place and a lot of learnings on Jainism.</p>
                    <p class="text">One last time we captured the sight of Varanga and bid a goodbye. It was 3 pm and we
                        resumed our journey towards Agumbe. The memories of Varanga is still fresh in our minds,
                        especially the ferry rides and breathtaking views. I will surely visit this place again!</p>
